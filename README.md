# bootplate-child
A blank starter child theme for the Bootplate theme framework.

## Previews
You can check out how this blank child theme for the Bootplate theme frameworks looks at: http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/childplate/.  

To take a closer look at the documentation and preview site for Bootplate itself, see: http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/

## Installation
Bootplate and this starter theme are not, as yet, available on the WordPress.org theme repo.  It may be at some point, but it’s not there yet.  Because it’s not there, you would have to manually update Bootplate periodically, and that’s a pain.  There’s a wonderful (and free) WordPress plugin called GitHub Updater which allows you to install and receive automatic theme and plugin updates for stuff securely hosted on GitHub.

Until Bootplate is available on the WordPress.org theme repo, this is the recommended installation process: http://bootplate.jdmdigital.co/setup/install/
